# 🧠 CNN-Based Waste Segregation

This project presents a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model for **automated waste classification**, designed to enhance waste management efficiency through AI-driven image recognition. The model identifies and categorizes waste types (e.g., biodegradable, recyclable, non-recyclable) to promote sustainable environmental practices.

## 🎯 Research Motivation
Effective waste segregation remains a key challenge in achieving sustainability and smart city goals. By leveraging **deep learning for visual classification**, this project explores how computer vision can automate and scale waste sorting — reducing human effort, minimizing contamination, and supporting data-driven recycling systems.

## 🔍 Overview
The notebook demonstrates the complete workflow — from **data preprocessing and augmentation** to **CNN model training, evaluation, and visualization**. The solution highlights how deep learning can be practically applied to sustainability-oriented problems.

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **Python**, **TensorFlow / Keras**  
- **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for experimentation and visualization  

## ⚙️ Execution
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cnn-waste-segregation.git
   cd cnn-waste-segregation
   ```
2. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook CNN_Waste_Segregation_AmitBothe.ipynb
   ```
3. Run all cells to train, evaluate, and visualize the model’s performance.
